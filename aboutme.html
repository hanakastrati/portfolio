    <p>Both Python and Scratch need to be given every little instruction so that they do what they're supposed to do. However Python was much easier to work with becasue it had to do whatever I said, not preset boxes. In addition, python is textbased and it tells you where your code is wrong in the terminal which makes it a lot easier to fix your mistakes or realize you forgot to put in a colon. I liked that I was imediately able to figure out where I went wrong and that I could easily fix it after that.</p>

    <p>Python was cool and I like how you can build your code all by yourself without the premade blocks. My game worked and I felt really accomplished and I enjoyed building it because it was a lot of fun to figure out what code to use and what would and wouldn't work since I don't know anything about python. Also, Eddy you're mad cool.</p>

    <p>Today's challenges were a lot of fun. They pushed me to think more and figure out how to make things work. I really enjoyed struggling to make my code work and then finally making it work. It was an educational day where I figured out and learned lots of different things. In addition, I really enjoyed today's speaker as well. It was so inspiring to have someone who is not American tell his story.</p>

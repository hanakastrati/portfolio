    <p>Both Python and Scratch need to be given every little instruction so that they do what they're supposed to do. However Python was much easier to work with becasue it had to do whatever I said, not preset boxes. In addition, python is textbased and it tells you where your code is wrong in the terminal which makes it a lot easier to fix your mistakes or realize you forgot to put in a colon. I liked that I was imediately able to figure out where I went wrong and that I could easily fix it after that.</p>
